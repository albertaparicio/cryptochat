# Cryptochat
Point to point Python-based encrypted chat.

This chat does not require a server to
relay the messages between users. The communication takes
place directly between the users.

## General specs

* Plaintext chat
* Point-to-point communication (no server relaying)
* The server only relays IP directions. It acts as a central point where all users meet
* PGP Encryption
* Terminal-based chat (GUI in next versions)
